## Running the tests
No automated test suite has been created for these files.

### Manual tests
1. Sort by Name. Is it sorted A-Z?
2. Sort by Name again. Is it sorted Z-A?
3. Repeat #1 and #2 for City and Province.
4. Type a common surname in the filter field. Are only those names shown?
5. With only those names filtered in, can you sort on Name, City, and Province?
6. When you remove the filter, do the original rows come back and can be sorted as in #1, #2, and #3?
